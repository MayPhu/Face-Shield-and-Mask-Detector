# Face-Shield-and-Mask-Detector
This is real time face-shield and mask detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV and it can detect shields and masks from both images and videos. 
Mask detector is created by following a tutorial of pyimagesearch (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/). 
Shield detector is created by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN). The images that are used for shield detector are downloaded from google images.
